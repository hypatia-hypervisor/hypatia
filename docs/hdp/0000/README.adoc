Hypatia Design Proposals
========================

Hypatia is described using a set of design proposals.  These
loosely follow the Oxide RFD format, and are in `asciidoc` or
`markdown`.

They go through states:

* needed
* draft
* discussion
* approved
* abandoned

We use a consensus model.

TODO(cross): It would be nice to have some mechanism for
hierarchical documents to aid discoverability and keeping things
up to date.
